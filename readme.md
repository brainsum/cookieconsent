# Cookieconsent Script

A script that displays a cookie consent message as required by EU regulation (GDPR). The plugin displays a message on the user's first visit and they have the ability to consent to different categories of cookies and services.

See the demo: [Cookieconsent](https://brainsum.github.io/cookieconsent/)

## Default look

![Cookieconsent modal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brainsum/cookieconsent/master/cc_modal_75.png "Cookieconsent modal")

## Features

- IE11 compatible
- Four different blocking methods
- Multilingual
- Mobile ready

Currently it can block all the bad cookie monsters in 4 ways.

### Dynamic script tags

Some services insert dynamically created script tags to the HEAD at page load. These can be intercepted and blocked.

### Script tag blocking

Some third party services require you to insert a script tag into your HTML pages. These can be inactivated until the user allowes them.

### Script wrapping

Some services are not inserted in a SCRIPT tag and are obscured by layers of other code. Thats why this script creates a global wrapper function what you can use to wrap and blovk any JS code.

### Local cookies

Finally the local cookies set on your domain can be also filtered by overriding the bowsers COOKIE SET method.

## Usage

1. Download the file cookieconsent.zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/brainsum/cookieconsent/releases/latest), and unpack its content.

2. Include the script file into your HTML page **before everything else.**

```
<script src="cookieconsent.js"></script>
```

3. Call the init() function with the Configuration Object.

See a working example in the docs folder.

### Configuration object

The script is being controlled mainly by a configuration object which is passed to the inital call. It acts as configuration and a global state object.

```javascript
<script>
  window.CookieConsent.init({
    // More link URL on bar
    modalMainTextMoreLink: null,
    // How lond to wait until bar comes up
    barTimeout: 1000,
    // Look and feel
